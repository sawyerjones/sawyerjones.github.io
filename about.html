                    <h2>Hello! I'm Sawyer Jones</h2>
                    <p>
                        I'm a passionate Computer Science student at San Diego State University, with a minor in Mathematics. 
                        I expect to graduate in 2026, and I am currently looking for internship opportunities for summer 2025. 
                        My journey in technology began when I first learned how to code in high school, and since then, I've been fascinated by the power of programming to solve real-world problems.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I am currently involved in a research project on campus, where we aim to help doctors diagnose the root cause of Raynaud's Syndrome.
                        We are working with a team of doctors to collect relevant data, and we are building our own hardware to collect data that typical wearables cannot.
