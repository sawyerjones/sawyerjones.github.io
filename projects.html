                        <h3>Project Overview</h3>
                        <p>
                            Developed a mobile application to assist doctors in collecting patient data.
                            Implemented in React Native with Node.js.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Key Features</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Voice controls and TTS for increased accesability</li>
                            <li>Multiple questionnaires for patients to complete</li>
                            <li>Ability to save multiple records, and easily export data as a CSV</li>
                            <li>Custom infrared sensor to collect patient temperature sensor</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3>Technical Details</h3>
                        <p>
                            React Native was chosen due to its user interface flexibility, performance with native components, lightweight application size, strong developer support, and data security.
                            Our app aligns with patient needs and medical care by enabling real-time symptom documentation through voice recognition and hands-free operation, ensuring privacy with local data storage and easy data transfer through CSV exports.
                            Initiated by symptom flare-ups, the app captures essential data like geolocation, weather, and health statistics, which can be shared with healthcare professionals for better clinical evaluation.

                        <h3>Project Overview</h3>
                        <p>
                            Created a programming language for creating graphics with code.
                            Implemented in Python using the <a href="https://github.com/manimCommunity/manim">Manim Community library.</a>
                        </p>
                        <h3>Key Features</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Ability to create text and shapes with controllable position and color</li>
                            <li>Animations allow for objects to move and interact with the scene</li>
                            <li>Renders are automatically saved as an MP4 for review</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3>Technical Details</h3>
                        <p>
                            The interpreter was written in Python due to Python's flexibilty and restraints of the Manim Community library. 
                            Interpretation is based on a TextX file that defines grammar rules, allowing syntax to be interpreted consistantly.
                            View was created to allow programmers to easily create graphics through code.
