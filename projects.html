                        <p>
                            Developed a mobile application to assist doctors in collecting patient data.
                            Implemented in React Native with Node.js.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Key Features</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Voice controls and TTS for increased accesability</li>
                            <li>Multiple questionnaires for patients to complete</li>
                            <li>Ability to save multiple records, and easily export data as a CSV</li>
                            <li>Custom infrared sensor to collect patient temperature sensor</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3>Technical Details</h3>
                        <p>
                            React Native was chosen due to its user interface flexibility, performance with native components, lightweight application size, strong developer support, and data security.
                            Our app aligns with patient needs and medical care by enabling real-time symptom documentation through voice recognition and hands-free operation, ensuring privacy with local data storage and easy data transfer through CSV exports.
                            Initiated by symptom flare-ups, the app captures essential data like geolocation, weather, and health statistics, which can be shared with healthcare professionals for better clinical evaluation.
