                        <h3>Project Overview</h3>
                        <p>
                            Developed a mobile application to assist doctors in collecting patient data.
                            Implemented in React Native with Node.js.
                            Published and presented a paper based on our research at IEEE Healthcom 2025.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Key Features</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Voice controls and TTS for increased accesability</li>
                            <li>Multiple questionnaires for patients to complete</li>
                            <li>Ability to save multiple records, and easily export data as a CSV</li>
                            <li>Custom infrared sensor to collect patient temperature sensor</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3>Technical Details</h3>
                        <p>
                            React Native was chosen due to its user interface flexibility, performance with native components, lightweight application size, strong developer support, and data security.
                            Our app aligns with patient needs and medical care by enabling real-time symptom documentation through voice recognition and hands-free operation, ensuring privacy with local data storage and easy data transfer through CSV exports.
                            Initiated by symptom flare-ups, the app captures essential data like geolocation, weather, and health statistics, which can be shared with healthcare professionals for better clinical evaluation.

                        <h3>Project Overview</h3>
                        <p>
                            Built a full stack file management system using FastAPI and React.
                            Deployed application onto a raspberry pi with SSL/HTTP configuration to enable remote network access.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Key Features</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Drag-and-drop file uploads</li>
                            <li>Mobile-responsive interface, supporting iOS/Android devices</li>
                            <li>RESTful API architecture with 10+ endpoints</li>
                            <li>Deployed production ready solution with SSL/HTTPS configurations</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3>Technical Details</h3>
                        <p>
                            FastAPI and Python were selected for the backend, allowing for efficient I/O operations and implementing JWT-based authentication with bcrypt password hashing.
                            The REST API features 10+ secure endpoints with comprehensive input validation, path traversal protection, and multipart file upload handling.
                            React allows for a modern, responsive frontend design, with hooks based state management.
                            The entire system is deployed on Linux, with SSL/TLS encryption and supports cross-device compatibilty through responsive design principles.

                        <p>
                            Created a programming language for creating graphics with code.
                            Implemented in Python using the <a href="https://github.com/manimCommunity/manim">Manim Community library.</a>
                        </p>
                        <h3>Key Features</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Ability to create text and shapes with controllable position and color</li>
                            <li>Animations allow for objects to move and interact with the scene</li>
                            <li>Renders are automatically saved as an MP4 for review</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3>Technical Details</h3>
                        <p>
                            The interpreter was written in Python due to Python's flexibilty and restraints of the Manim Community library. 
                            Interpretation is based on a TextX file that defines grammar rules, allowing syntax to be interpreted consistantly.
                            View was created to allow programmers to easily create graphics through code.

                            Created a simple website allowing users to create accounts and track todos.
                            Implemented using <a href="https://supabase.com">Supabase</a> to host the database.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Key Features</h3>

                        </ul>
                        <h3>Technical Details</h3>
                        <p>
                            Leverages React's component based architecture to create a responsive user interface, enabling dynamic updates without page refresh.
                            Supabase was chosen as the backend for its built in authentication system, allowing for data synchronization across clients.
                            Taskify was created as a means to learn more about state management and working with backend databases.
